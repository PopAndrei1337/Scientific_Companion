# Scientific_Companion
Scientific_Companion is a general purpose calculator designed for middle-school students. 
The project was made with the help of Java Swing, a GUI widget toolkit, and it provides a graphical frame with calculator categories. 
These calculator categories provide the ability to compute formulae. 
The calculator categories present in this project are there to help students finish their homework faster or verify themselves at subjects such as mathematics and physics.
